⦿ Project Overview and Data Set

In this project, we built a Pandas Database using Collab, Machine Learning, Xgboost as well as other dictionary methods to extract and transform data. We accessed the insurance ipynb files to find out the accurate prediction details about the charges of Medical insurance costs based off an individual’s age, sex, BMI, Children, Smoker status, Region and used the filtered Dataset to create graphs and data lists to show the result.

Our dataset is used to predict insurance charges based on the person’s age, sex, body mass index, number of children, smoking status, and region. We used the dataset to understand and analyze which variables can affect a person’s insurance premiums. Age is likely to be the most important variable as young customers and old customers may pay more or less. BMI is another important element when predicting insurance cost due to different factors like obesity risks and likely to affect premium pricing decisions. Because smokers are more likely to develop health concerns and therefore represent a great risk, insurance companies may charge up to 50% more for premiums. Lastly, number of children and location has big effect on customers premiums. Differences in competition, local and state policies, and cost of living account for the location charges.
